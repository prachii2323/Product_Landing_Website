              of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web
              publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the

              Mobile application development is the process of making software
              for smartphones, tablets and digital assistants, most commonly for
              the Android and iOS operating systems. The software can be
              preinstalled on the device, downloaded from a mobile app store or
              accessed through a mobile web browser.

            <p>
              Your UI and UX developers fall in the first category, front-end
              developers. Their role is to make work the visual element of an
              app or website, working with UI and UX designers. As we said
              before, designers take care of the aesthetic and creative aspects
              of the interface, while developers focus on making these visual
              elements function smoothly and coherently.
